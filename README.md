# S3 Avro Repair

NodeJs application to connect and download avro from S3 bucket, test and repair.
This application has been builded to solve a specific problem, so improvements can be done.

I wish this project can be used to "start" from other people needs. In no way can I be held responsible for any loss of
data or problems that the application may cause **(use at your own risk)**

### Avro Tools

Documentation about the tool and details can be
seen [here](https://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2013/03/17/reading-and-writing-avro-files-from-the-command-line/).


### Settings

It's necessary set the path of Java will be used to run Avro Tools. To configure edit the [application.yml](resources/application.yml).
If you don't know where is the Java, you can use the whereis java command to show.

### Install

```bash
npm install --no-optional 
```

The parameters must be set via process variables for NodeJS. Here are the available settings:
